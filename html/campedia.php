<h2>Backpack</h2>
<p>A backpack big enough to carry a swim suit, change of clothes, swim towel and goggles is a basic necessity of every summer day camp experience.  We like the backpacks offered at <a href="http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/818?page=kids-backpacks" target="_blank">LL Bean</a>, for their sturdiness and size.  Younger kids may find the junior backpacks (which will just fit a smaller towel and change of clothes) to be easier to carry.

<h2>Clothes (what to wear)</h2>
<p>Comfortable clothes are key to a great camp experience. Think about shorts and t-shirts that are fun and lightweight. Younger kids, who may have trouble quickly changing for swimming, should have clothes that are easy to take on and off (no tricky buttons or zippers). For those extra hot days, a simple sundress is great for girls.

<h2>Friends (coordination)</h2>
<p>You find the perfect camp for your son or daughter only to find out that they insist on going with their very best friend.  How do you coordinate with other families?  Use the share feature (link) on Campseekers to connect your children's summer schedules with their best friends' families.

<h2>Shoes</h2>
<p>Many camps require close-toed shoes which can be challenging when looking for comfortable sandals for the summer.  Water shoes (those that can get wet without worry) are also helpful.  Merrell has a shoe for girls called the <a href="http://www.merrell.com/US/en-US/Product.mvc.aspx/30999Y/75004/Youth/Aquaterra-Sprite-MJ-Kids?dimensions=0" target="_blank">Aquaterra Sprite MJ</a>. Teva offers the <a href="http://www.teva.com/kids-toachi-2-tough-sport-sandals/1000329,default,pd.html?green=77C0E5EB-9186-5424-9975-1D277631C013" target="_blank">Youth Toachi 2</a>, which is great for water sports.
