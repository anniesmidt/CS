      <h3>What is Campseekers?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
      Campseekers simplifies summer scheduling by providing parents with a targeted list of summer camp sessions that meet specific criteria.  We are the only service where parents can not only save their favorite sessions but can then share them with friends.
        </p><p>
Campseekers, in turn, provides camps with prospective parents who have self-selected their interest in the specific sessions offered by the camps.
        </p>

       <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
      Consumers can search by location, date and camp type (i.e. sports) to find camp sessions that meet their specific criteria.  From the results page, they can then filter by activity (i.e. soccer), age/school year or cost to find the camp sessions that best fit their summer goals.  Consumers can save their favorite sessions and share them with friends.
        </p><p>
Camps can promote individual sessions based on broad categories like session date or category type to specific details like activity, age or cost.
