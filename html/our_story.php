    <h1>Simplifying Summer Scheduling</h1>   

    <div class="static-text">
        <p>Campseekers was started by a group of Boston parents who wanted their children to enjoy a great summer camp experience in an environment that was safe and well run.  Today, Campseekers represents the most extensive directory of individual camp sessions in the greater Boston area.  Parents can search for camps by broad categories like start date or age and can then filter by camp types like soccer or photography.  Once they've found their favorite sessions, they can save them and share them with their friends, an invaluable tool when coordinating summer schedules.</p>

<p>For camps, Campseekers is the first resource to offer access to parents who are looking for specific types of camp, like baseball or cooking, and tracking the popularity of various types of camps and specific weeks.  We can target your camp to the family who is actively looking for your program offerings.</p>
